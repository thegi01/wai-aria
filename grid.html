		<h1>Grids : Interactive Tabular Data and Layout Containers</h1>
		<p>
			A grid widget is a container that enables users to navigate the information or interactive elements it contains using directional navigation keys, such as arrow <kbd>keys</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, and <kbd>End</kbd>. <br>
			As a generic container widget that offers flexible keyboard navigation, it can serve a wide variety of needs. <br>
			It can be used for purposes as simple as grouping a collection of checkboxes or navigation links or as complex as creating a full-featured spreadsheet application. <br>
			While ARIA properties and assistive technologies use row and column nomenclature when describing and presenting the logical structure of elements widh the grid role, using the grid role on an element does not necessarily imply that its visual presentation is tabular.
		</p>
		<p>
			When presenting content that is tabular, consider the following factors when choosing between implementing this grid pattern or the table pattern.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A grid is a composite widget so it :
				<ul>
					<li>Always contains multiple focusable elements.</li>
					<li>Has only one focusable element in the page tab sequence.</li>
					<li>Requires the author to provide code that manages focus movement inside it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>All focusable elements contained in a table are included in the page tab sequence. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Uses of the grid pattern broadly fall into two categories: <span class="underline">presenting tabular information (data grids)</span> and <span class="underline">grouping other widgets (layout grids)</span>. <br>
			Even thouth both data grids and layout grids employ the same ARIA roles, states, and properties, <span class="underline">differences in their content and purpose surface factors that are important to consider in kyeboard interaction design.</span> <br>
			To address these factors, the following two sections describe separate keyboard interaction patterns for data and layout grids.
		</p>
		
		<section class="section">
			<h2><sup>[Section 1]</sup> Data Grids For Presenting Tabluar Infomation</h2>
			<p> 
				A grid can be used to present <span class="underline">tabular information</span> that has column titles, row titles, or both. <br>
				The grid pattern is particularly useful if the tabular information is <span class="underline">editable or interactive</span>. <br>
				For example, <span class="underline">when data elements are links to more information</span>, rather than presenting them in a static table and including the links in the tab sequence, implementing the grid pattern provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation of the grid contetns as well ss shorter tab sequence for the page. <br>
				A grid may also offer functions, such as <span class="underline">cell content editing, slections, cut, copy, and pate</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a grid that presents tabular data, every cell contains <span class="underline">a focusable element or is iteself focusable</span>, regardless of whether the cell content is editable or interactive. <br>
				There is one <strong>exception</strong>: if column or row header cells do not provide functions, such ar sort or filter, they do not need to be focusable. <br>
				One reason this is important is that <span class="underline">screen readers need to be in their application reading mode</span>, rather than their document reading mode, while the user is interacting with the grid. <br>
				While in application reading mode, a screen reader user can only discover focusable elements and content that labels focusable elements. <br>
				So, <span class="underline">a screen reader user may unknowningly overlook elements contained in a grid that are either not focusable or not used to label a column or row.</span> <br>
				A more detailed description of this topic with examples is available in the section descrbing screen reader document and application reading modes.

				<h3>Keyboard Interaction For Data Grids</h3>
				<p>
					The follwing keys provde grid navigation by moving focus among cells of the grid. <br>
					These key commands are available by default after an elelment in the grid receives focus.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>
						: Moves focus one cell to the right. If focus is on the right-most cell in the row, focus does not move. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
						: Moves focus one cell to the left. If focus is on the left-most in the row, focus does not move.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
						: Moves focus one cell down. If focus is on the bottom cell in the column, focus does not move.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
						: Moves focus one cell up, If focus is on the top cell in the column, focus does not move.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Page down</kbd>
						: Moves focus down an author-determined number of rows, typically scrolling so the bottom row in the currently visible set of rows becomes one of the first visible rows. If focus is in the alst row of the gird, focus does not move.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Page Up</kbd>
						: Moves focus up an author-determined number of rows, typically scrolling so the top row in the currently visible set of rows becomes one of the last visible rows. If focus is in the first row of the gird, focus deos not move.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Home</kbd>
						: Moves focus to the first cell in the row that contains focus.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>End</kbd>
						: Moves focus to the last cell in the row that contains focus.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Control + Home</kbd>
						: Moves focus to the first cell in the first row.
					</li>
					<li>
						<kbd>Control + End</kbd>
						: Moves focus to the last cell in the last row.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="note">
					<h4>NOTE</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When the above grid navigation keys move focus, whether the focus is set on an element insdie the cell or the grid cell depends on cell content, See <a href="#gridNav_focus">Whether to Focus on a Cell or an Element Insdie It</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							While navigation keys, such as arrow keys, are moving focus from cell to cell, they are not available to do something like operate a combobox or move an editing caret inside of a cell. If this functionality is needed, see <a href="#gridNav_inside">Editing and Navigation Inside a Cell</a>.
							While navigation keys, such as arrow keys, are moving focus from cell to cell, they are not available to do something like operate a combobox or move an editing caret inside of a cell. If this functionality is needed, see Editing and Navigating Inside a Cell.
						</li>
						<li>
							If navigation functions can dynamically add more rows or columns to the DOM, key events that move focus to the beginning or end of the grid, such as <kbd>control + end</kbd>, may move focus to the <span class="underline">last row in the DOM</span> rather than the last available row in the back-end data.
