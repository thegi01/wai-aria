		<h1>Grids : Interactive Tabular Data and Layout Containers</h1>
		<p>
			A grid widget is a container that enables users to navigate the information or interactive elements it contains using directional navigation keys, such as arrow <kbd>keys</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, and <kbd>End</kbd>. <br>
			As a generic container widget that offers flexible keyboard navigation, it can serve a wide variety of needs. <br>
			It can be used for purposes as simple as grouping a collection of checkboxes or navigation links or as complex as creating a full-featured spreadsheet application. <br>
			While ARIA properties and assistive technologies use row and column nomenclature when describing and presenting the logical structure of elements widh the grid role, using the grid role on an element does not necessarily imply that its visual presentation is tabular.
		</p>
		<p>
			When presenting content that is tabular, consider the following factors when choosing between implementing this grid pattern or the table pattern.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A grid is a composite widget so it :
				<ul>
					<li>Always contains multiple focusable elements.</li>
					<li>Has only one focusable element in the page tab sequence.</li>
					<li>Requires the author to provide code that manages focus movement inside it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>All focusable elements contained in a table are included in the page tab sequence. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Uses of the grid pattern broadly fall into two categories: <span class="underline">presenting tabular information (data grids)</span> and <span class="underline">grouping other widgets (layout grids)</span>. <br>
			Even thouth both data grids and layout grids employ the same ARIA roles, states, and properties, <span class="underline">differences in their content and purpose surface factors that are important to consider in kyeboard interaction design.</span> <br>
			To address these factors, the following two sections describe separate keyboard interaction patterns for data and layout grids.
		</p>
		
		<section class="section">
			<h2><sup>[Section 1]</sup> Data Grids For Presenting Tabluar Infomation</h2>
			<p> 
				A grid can be used to present <span class="underline">tabular information</span> that has column titles, row titles, or both. <br>
				The grid pattern is particularly useful if the tabular information is <span class="underline">editable or interactive</span>. <br>
				For example, <span class="underline">when data elements are links to more information</span>, rather than presenting them in a static table and including the links in the tab sequence, implementing the grid pattern provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation of the grid contetns as well ss shorter tab sequence for the page. <br>
				A grid may also offer functions, such as <span class="underline">cell content editing, slections, cut, copy, and pate</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a grid that presents tabular data, every cell contains <span class="underline">a focusable element or is iteself focusable</span>, regardless of whether the cell content is editable or interactive. <br>
				There is one <strong>exception</strong>: if column or row header cells do not provide functions, such ar sort or filter, they do not need to be focusable. <br>
				One reason this is important is that <span class="underline">screen readers need to be in their application reading mode</span>, rather than their document reading mode, while the user is interacting with the grid. <br>
				While in application reading mode, a screen reader user can only discover focusable elements and content that labels focusable elements. <br>
				So, <span class="underline">a screen reader user may unknowningly overlook elements contained in a grid that are either not focusable or not used to label a column or row.</span> <br>
				A more detailed description of this topic with examples is available in the section descrbing screen reader document and application reading modes.

			<h2><sup>[Section 2]</sup> Layout Grids for Grouping Widgets</h2>
			<p>
				The grid pattern can be used to group a set of interactive elements, such as links, buttons, or checkboxes. <br>
				Since only one element in the entire grid is included in the tab sequence, <span class="underline">grouping with a grid can dramatically reduce the number of tab stops on a page</span>. <br>
				This is especially valuable <span class="underline">if scrolling through a list of elements dynamically loads more of those elements from a large data set</span>, such as in a continuous list of suggested products on a shopping site. <br>
				If elements in a list like this were in the tab sequence, keyboard users are effectively trapped in the list. <br>
				If any elements in the group also have associated elements that <span class="underline">appear on hover</span>	, the grid pattern is also useful for providing keyboard access to those contextual elements of the user interface.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike grids used to present data, <span class="underline">A grid used for layout does not necessarily have header cells for labeling rows or columns and might contain only a single row or a single column</span>. <br>
				Even if it has multiple rows and columns, it may present <span class="underline">a single, logically homogenous set of elements</span>. <br>
				For example, a list of recipients for a message may be a grid where each cell contains a link that represents a recipient. <br>
				The grid may initially have a single row but then wrap into multiple rows as recipients are added. <br>
				In such circumstances, grid navigation keys may also wrap so the user can read list from beginning to end by pressing either <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>. <br>
				While this type of focus movement wrapping can be very helpful in a layout grid, it would be disorienting if used in a data grid, especially for users of assistive technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because arrow keys are used to move focus inside of a grid, a grid is both easier to build and use if the components it contains do not require the arrow keys to operate. <br>
				If a cell contains an element like a listbox, then a extra key command to focus and activate the listbox is needed as well as a command for restoring the grid navigation functionality. <br>
				Aprocahes to supporting this need are described in the section on <a href="#gridNav-inside">Editing and Navigating Inside a cell</a>.

			<h3 class="h3">Keyboard Interaction - Setting Focus and Navigating Inside Cells</h3>
			<p>
				This section describes two important aspects of keyboard interaction design shared by both data and layout grid patterns:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Choosing wheter a cell or an element inside a cell receives focus in response to grid navigation key events.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enabling grid navigation keys to be used to interact with elements inside of a cell.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h5>Whether to focus on a Cell or an Element Inside IT</h5>
			<p>
				For assistive technology users, the quality of experience when navigating a grid heavily depends on both what a cell contains and on where keyboard focus is set. <br>
				For example, if a cell contains a button and a grid navigation key places focus on the cell instead of button, screen readers announce the button label but do not tell users a button is prsent.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two optimal cell design and focus behavior combinations:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A cell contains one widget whose operation does not require arrow keys and grid navigation keys set focus on that widget. <br>
					Exmaples of such widgets include link, button, menubutton, toggle button, radio button (not radio group), switch, and cehckbox.
				</li>
				<li>
					A cell contains text or a single graphic and grid navigation keys set focus on the cell.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				While any combination of widgets, text, and graphics may be included in a single cell, grids that do not follow one of these two cell design and focus movement patterns add compelxity for authors or user or both. <br>
				The reference implementations included in the example section below demostrate some strategies for making other cell designs as accessible as possible, but the most widely accessible experiences are likely to come by applying the above two patterns.
			</p>

			<h5>Editing and Navigating Inside a Cell </h5>
			<p>
				While navigation keys, such as arrow keys, are moving focus from cell to cell, they are not available to perform actions like operate a combobox or move an editing caret inside of a cell. The user may need keys that are used for grid navigation to operate elements inside a cell if a cell contains:
 			</p>
 			<ol>
 				<li>Editable content.</li>
 				<li>Multiple widgets.</li>
 				<li>A widget that utilizes arrow keys in its interaction model, such as a radio group or slider. </li>
 			</ol>
 			<p>Following are common keyboard conventions for <span class="underline">disabling and restoring grid navigation functions</span>. </p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>
 					<kbd>Enter</kbd>: Disables grid navigation and :
 					<ul>
 						<li>
 							If the cell contains editable content, places focus in an input field, such as a textbox. <br>
 							If the input is a single-line text field, a subsequent press of <kbd>Enter</kbd> may either restore grid navigation functions or move focus to an input field in a neighboring cell.
 						</li>
 						<li>
 							If the cell contains one or more widgets, places focus on the first widget.
 						</li>
 					</ul>
 				</li>
 				<li>
 					<kbd>F2</kbd>: 
 					<ul>
 						<li>
 							If the cell contains editable content, places focus in an input field, such as a textbox. <br>
 							A subsequent press of <kbd>F2</kbd> restores grid navigation functions.
 						</li>
 						<li>
 							If the cell contains one or more widgets, places focus on the first widget. <br>
 							A subsequent press of <kbd>F2</kbd> restores grid navigation functions.
 						</li>
 					</ul>
 				</li>
 				<li>
 					<kbd>Alphanumeric keys</kbd>
 					: If the cell contains editable content, places focus in an input field, such as a textbox.
 				</li>
 			</ul>
			
			<p>When grid navigation is disabled, conventional changes to navigation behaviros include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<kbd>Escape</kbd>
					: Restores grid navigation. If content was being edited, it may also undo edits.
				</li>
				<li>
					<kbd>Right Arrow or Down Arrow</kbd>
					: If the cell contains multiple widgets, moves focus to the next widget inside the cell, optionally wrapping to the first widget if focus is on the last widget. Otherwise, passes the key event to the focused widget.
				</li>
				<li>
					<kbd>Left Arrow or Up Arrow</kbd>
					: If the cell contains multiple widgets, moves focus to the previous widget inside the cell, optionally wrapping to the first widget if focus is on the ast widget. Otherwise, passes the key event to the focused widget. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<kbd>Tab</kbd>
					: Moves focus to the next widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside an single cell or within the grid itself.
				</li>
				<li>
					<kbd>Shieft + Tab</kbd>
					: Moves focus to the previous widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself.
				</li>
			</ul>
